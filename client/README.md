Here's how you can improve the `client/README.md` file:

1. **Add a Table of Contents:** Helps users navigate through the document.
2. **Add Sections for Description, Prerequisites, and Setup:** Provide an overview of the project, any prerequisites, and detailed setup instructions.
3. **Code Block Formatting:** Use code blocks for commands.
4. **Add Usage Instructions:** Explain how to run and use the client.
5. **Add Contribution Guidelines:** If you want others to contribute, provide guidelines.
