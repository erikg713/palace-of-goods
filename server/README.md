Here are some suggestions to improve the `server/README.md` file:

1. Add a Table of Contents to help users navigate through the document easily.
2. Add sections for Description, Prerequisites, and Setup to provide an overview of the project and detailed setup instructions.
3. Use code blocks for commands to improve readability.
4. Add Usage Instructions to explain how to run and use the backend.
5. Add Contribution Guidelines if you want others to contribute.
6. Add License Information to specify the license under which the project is distributed.

Here's an improved version:
