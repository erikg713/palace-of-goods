## Key Improvements

The enhanced configuration includes several beneficial additions:

1. **Scheduled Days and Times**: Specifies updates to occur on Monday mornings, allowing your team to address dependencies at the beginning of the work week.

2. **Designated Reviewers**: Added reviewer assignments for each update type, ensuring the appropriate team members evaluate changes.

3. **Security Prioritization**: Enabled automatic security updates for both npm configurations.

4. **Refined Commit Messages**: Added structured commit message prefixes to improve change tracking and visibility.

5. **Additional Labels**: Enhanced labeling for the client-side updates to distinguish frontend-specific changes.

6. **Example Ignore Rule**: Demonstrated how to exclude specific packages or versions from automatic updates if needed.

Please replace the placeholder reviewer names ("team-leads" and "devops-team") with actual GitHub usernames or teams from your organization. You may also customize the ignore rules based on any packages that require special handling in your project.
